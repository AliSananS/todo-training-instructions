I'm going to give you an overview of how the model is supposed to work. And I want you to create a brief explanation of what this application is about and what is the job of the AI model and how it should respond, what should it respond with and what to avoid, etc.
For now you'll only create a brief intro to the AI model to provide the context of this application. 
I'll use this a template to add my own information if needed.
Create an intro that can be attached on top of this training file.

The intro should start with what you (The AI model ) are?
How I'm going to use you without providing any technical details. 

This is the markdown training data for the AI model that will be used.

## How it works?

The todo engine manages a database of to-do lists in a json format on the file system and updates it based on the data provided by the AI model  in a json format, which is generated by the model after the user's prompt.

## How does the database look like

The database is an array of todos that look like the code below.

```json
{
"todos": [
   {"id": 88277,
    "title": "Title of the Todo",
    "description": "Description of the task.",
    "time": "16:00/01/01/2024",
    "priority": "important",
    "urgent": "false",
    "notificationType": "alarm",
    "isCompleted": false,
    "expires": "22:00/01/01/2024"
   }
]
}
```

# Todo Data Documentation

## Data Structure

Each to-do item is represented as a JSON object with the following fields:

- **todos (array)**: The array of tasks which will be run by the todo engine to update the existing todo data or add new one.  
- **id (Integer)**: A unique identifier for each to-do item.
- **title (String)**: The title of the to-do.
- **description (String)**: A brief description of the task.
- **time (String)**: Time at which the task is scheduled. It is represented in the format "HH:MM/DD/MM/YYYY".
- **priority (String)**: The importance level of the task. Possible options are "low", "high" and "critical".
- **urgent (Boolean)**: A Boolean value ("true" or "false") indicating whether the task is urgent.
- **notificationType (String)**: The type of notification set for the task. Possible options are “notification”, “alarm” and “silent”.
- **isCompleted (Boolean)**: A Boolean value indicating whether the task has been completed.
- **expires (String)**: The expiration time of the task, represented in the format "HH:MM/DD/MM/YYYY".

## Engine Methods

The engine manipulates the todo database using `JSON` data provided by the **AI model** and supports the following operation **methods**:

- **add**: Add a new to-do item.
    
- **update**: Update an existing to-do item.
    
- **delete**: Remove a to-do item from the database, by the given id number.
    

### add

**Add is the method that takes the following parameters:**

- `id`
- `title`
- `description`
- `time`
- `priority`
- `urgent`
- `notificationType`
- `isCompleted`
- `expires`

### update

**update method can take the following parameters based on the data that needs to be updated.**
- `id`
- `title`
- `description`
- `time`
- `priority`
- `urgent`
- `notificationType`
- `isCompleted`
- `expires`

### delete

Delete is the method that only requires the `id` of the todo item to be removed.

## How does prompt look like?
Prompt is a natural language command the describes the user's situation like their dAIly routine, work schedule, sleeping routine and other essential and none essential tasks.
Once user describes how their day go, they probably won't need to remind the model agAIn.

#### This is how the prompt should look like.

**Prompt (no existing tasks yet):** `Hi! I'm a software developer at a startup, and my days are packed with coding, meetings, and emAIls. I start around 8 a.m., squeezing in focused work between meetings and debugging sessions. Lunch is usually at my desk. I wrap up by 7 or 8 p.m., but often continue late into the night. My goal? To be more efficient with my time and find a better work-life balance. Can you help me organize my chaotic schedule?`

**Response:**
- The response should be a few questions by the model to create a robust todo plan on how the user want to schedule their day.
- Questions should be like asking about the user's goals, their habits, how their day goes and what makes them motivated to do what they want to achieve.
- These questions can go on until the AI models' all confusions and questions are clear.
- Then the model is expected to respond with a well organized and robust data about the tasks based on the user's situation and goals.
- The response is a json format data that contAIns the generated tasks by the AI model. 
- The response is expected to have the following detAIls about the tasks that can be interpreted by the Todo list application to to create a todo list for the user.
**This is an example response the AI model is expected to provide:**
`response:`
```json{
  "todos": [
    {
      "id": 88277,
      "method": "add",
      "title": "Finish Project Proposal",
      "description": "Write and finalize project proposal document.",
      "time": "10:00/04/30/2024",
      "priority": "important",
      "urgent": false,
      "notificationType": "alarm",
      "isCompleted": false,
      "expires": "15:00/04/30/2024"
    },
    {
      "id": 88278,
      "method": "delete",
      "title": "Call Client",
      "description": "Discuss project requirements and schedule meeting.",
      "time": "14:00/04/30/2024",
      "priority": "high",
      "urgent": true,
      "notificationType": "notification",
      "isCompleted": false,
      "expires": "16:00/04/30/2024"
    }
  ]
}
```

#### A high level JavaScript code that demonstrates how the todo updating engine works.

```js
import todoManager from "./utils/todo"; // This is the todo updater engine that takes response as the prameter.
import exampleResponse from "./exampleResponse.js" // This response is generated by AI model by providing the user prompt to the model.

const response = exampleResponse;

// In this case the data is `todo` provided by the AI model.

response.todos.forEach(todo => {
    switch (todo.method) {
        case "add":
            todoManager.add(todo);
            break;
        case "delete":
            todoManager.delete(todo);
            break;
        case "update":
            todoManager.update(todo);
            break;
        default:
            console.error("Invalid method:", todo.method);
    }
});
```
```
